## Explorers

Explorers will help you to compare 1000s of AI experiments with a few clicks.
Explorers are the main tools that Aim is built around.

In this section we will go through the Aim explorers, introduce their features and how to use them.


### Metrics Explorer

#### Overview

Use Metrics explorer to search and compare 1000s of ML training metrics.

The Metrics Explorer allows you to search, group and compare your metrics.
Due to this and number of other visual features on the Metrics Explorer, you will save considerable amounts of time when comparing experiments- compared to other open-source experiment tracking tools.

The Metric Explorer has the following main sections:
- **Metrics Select:** to select the metrics for exploration
- **Search bar:** to query the runs for exploration
- **Charts explorer:** the space where the metrics are rendered
- **Metrics modifiers:** all the grouping, chart division and other metrics modifier tools
- **Context table:** the full information about the selected metrics is available

.. note::
There is also an advanced mode of search is available too where you can use the full Aim QL (more on this further in this section).

There are two ways you can query metrics and runs
- [Select metrics and query runs](#id1)
- [Advanced Search mode](#advanced-search-mode)

An overview of what you can do with queried metrics - the modifiers:
- [Group by tracked parameters](#group-by-any-parameter)
- [Aggregate grouped metrics](#aggregate-metrics)
- [Align metrics by time, epoch or custom metric](#x-axis-properties)
- [Change scale of the axes (linear or log)](#axes-scale)
- [Apply smoothing](#chart-smoothing)
- [Ignore outliers](#ignore-outliers)
- [Metric highligh modes (metric on hover, run on hover)](#highlight-modes)
- [Set chart tooltip parameters](#set-tooltip-parameters)
- [Apply zoom in/out on charts](#apply-zoom-on-charts)
- [Export chart as image](#export-chart-as-image)

#### Select metrics and query runs
On the Metrics Explorer, there is `+ Metrics` button.
Once pressed, a dropdown will appear with all your tracked metrics and their contexts flattened.
The dropdown is searchable - so you can get to your metric of interest within a stroke!

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/select_form_dropdown.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="select_form_dropdown" />

The Search bar is located below the `+ Metric` button. It allows to do a pythonic query (that is eval-ed as python statement) over every param you have tracked.

Search runs with [Aim QL](../../using/search.html)

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/select_form_filter.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="select_form_filter" />

#### Advanced Search mode

Once you press the `Enable advanced search mode` button underneath the main `Search` button, it will enable the full Aim QL search editor - to query the metrics, the runs via full Aim QL

Here is an example:

`((metric.name == 'bleu' and metric.context.subset == 'val') or (metric.name == 'loss' and metric.context.subset == 'train'))
and 1e-5 < run.hparams.learning_rate < 1e-2`

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/select_form_advanced_search.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="select_form_advanced_search" />

#### Group by any parameter

Grouping selected metrics by any tracked params will allow you to quickly distinguish the most impactful params, decisions you have made (the preprocessing steps, the hyperparams etc).

The parameters include not only the ones you have tracked but also the native Aim objects too such as
- `metric.name`
- `metric.context.[context_key]`
- `run.hash`

There are several ways you can group the selected metrics and runs - by color, by stroke and by chart.

##### Group by Color
Use this to divide the selected metrics into different clusters based on selected values of params.
Each cluster gets colored differently.

There are a number of options available when grouping
- **group by values** - divides into clusters as per the values of selected params)
- **reverse grouping** - divides into clusters by every param except for the chosen one.

The grouping colors are picked randomly, however it is possible to fix with the advanced coloring features.

Here are the features in the advanced mode:
- Fix the colors of the grouping
- Control the color palette to use during the grouping

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/groupby_color.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="groupby_color" />

##### Group by Stroke
Groups the metrics by a stroke style.
Has all the rest of the other features available on the color grouping except the advanced mode.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/groupby_stroke.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="groupby_stroke" />

##### Group by Chart
The end result of using this feature: divides into subplots based on the value of the selected params.
Why this is a grouping mechanism? It groups the metrics belonging to the same group into separate charts.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/groupby_chart.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="groupby_chart" />

#### Aggregate metrics

The metrics aggregation helps to quickly see the trends of each individual group of metrics. See more about [metrics grouping](#group-by-any-parameter).

There are two aspects of aggregation you can control:
- the trend-line
- the area that the group of metricsc take

The trend-line calculation methods:
- Mean
- Median
- Min
- Max

The area calcualtion methods:
- None _(when you'd like to remove the area)_
- Min/Max
- Mean +/- Standard Deviation
- Mean +/- Standard Error
- Confidence Interval (95%)

Pls see the screenshot:

#### X-Axis properties

X-Axis properties section is for controlling density of metrics x-axis values and aligning metrics by time, epoch or another metric.

##### Density:

Following types of metrics density are available: [Minimum](#minimum), [Medium](#medium), [Maximum](#maximum).
By default, metrics density is the [Maximum](#maximum).

###### Minimum

By setting metrics density to Minimum, will query metrics by 50 point.

###### Medium

By setting metrics density to Medium, will query metrics by 250 point.

###### Maximum

By setting metrics density to Maximum, will query metrics by 500 point.

##### Alignment:

Following types of metrics alignment are available: [Step](#step), [Epoch](#epoch), [Relative Time](#relative-time), [Absolute Time](#absolute-time) and [Custom Metric](#custom-metric).
By default, metrics aligned by [Step](#step).

###### Step

By setting metrics alignment to Step, x-axis values will represent the steps of tracked metrics.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/alignment_step.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="alignment_step" />

###### Epoch

By setting metrics alignment to Epoch, x-axis values will represent the epochs of tracked metrics.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/alignment_epoch.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="alignment_epoch" />

###### Relative Time

By setting metrics alignment to Relative Time, x-axis values will represent by `HH:mm:ss`, duration of tracking process.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/alignment_relative.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="alignment_relative" />

###### Absolute Time

By setting metrics alignment to Absolute Time, x-axis values will represent by date `HH:mm:ss D MMM, YY`, since the start date of the first run until the last run.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/alignment_absolute.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="alignment_absolute" />

###### Custom Metric

By setting metrics alignment to Custom Metric, x-axis values will represent selected metric values, you can detect correlations between queried metrics and selected metric.

#### Axes Scale

Axes Scale section gives ability to display axes scale's [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_scale) or [logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale).

By default, axes scale's are [Linear](#linear-scale).

##### Linear Scale

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/axes_scale_linear.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="axes_scale_linear" />

##### X-axis scale: Linear, Y-axis scale: Log

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/y_axis_scale_log.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="y-axis-scale-log" />

##### X-axis scale: Log, Y-axis scale: Linear

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/x_axis_scale_log.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="x-axis-scale-log" />

##### Log Scale

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/axes_scale_log.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="axes-scale-log" />

#### Chart Smoothing

While smoothing the chart, the data points are modified so individual points higher than the adjacent points (presumably because of noise) are reduced, and points that are lower than the adjacent points are increased leading to a smoother signal.
You can select curve interpolation methods: Linear or Cubic.
By default, chart smoothing in [Exponential moving average](#exponential-moving-average) mode and curve interpolation method is Linear.

##### Exponential moving average

An [exponential moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average), also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA),
is a first-order infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/smoothing_ema.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="smoothing_ema" />

##### Centered moving average

When you center the moving averages, the data points are placed at the center of the range rather than the end of it.
This is done to position the moving average values at their central positions in time.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/smoothing_cma.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="smoothing_cma" />

#### Ignore outliers

An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population.
Examination of the data for unusual observations that are far removed from the mass of data.
These points are often referred to as outliers.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/ignore_outliers_off.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="ignore-outliers-off" />

Excluding outliers can cause your results to become statistically significant.
By default, outliers are ignored.

<img src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/metrics-explorer/ignore_outliers_on.png" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" alt="ignore-outliers-on" />

It represents graph where corresponding values from a set of data are placed as points on a coordinate plane. A relationship between the points is sometimes shown to be positive, negative, strong, or weak.

<img alt="scatters-explore" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/scatters.png">

Abilities provided by Scatter explorer

- [Easily align metric last value data with hyper parameter](#align-metric-last-value-data-with-hyper-parameter)
- [Group runs by color and chart](#grouping)
- [Represent the points with trend line](#trend-line)
- [Export chart](#export-chart)

##### Align metric last value data with hyper-parameter

Select params and metrics from `X` and `Y` axes dropdowns to align metric last value data with hyper-parameter.

- X axis

<img alt="x axis dropdown" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/select-x-axis.png">

- Y axis

<img alt="y axis dropdown" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/select-y-axis.png">

Also, you can search runs with [Aim QL](../../using/search.html)

<img alt="search runs" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/scatters-search.png">

##### Grouping

Easily group data by color and chart with selected parameters.

- By `Color`

<img alt="Grouping color" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/scatters-color-group.png">

- By `Chart`

<img alt="Grouping chart line" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/scatters-color-group.png">

##### Trend line

A trend line is a straight line that best represents the points on a `scatter plot`. The trend line may go through some points but need not go through them all.

<img alt="trend line" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/trendline.png">

From trend line options popover you can change regression from `Linear` (by default) to `LOESS`(locally weighted smoothing), which creates a smooth line through a `scatter plot` to help you to see relationship between variables and foresee trends. Also, you can change the `bandwidth` with `slider`

<img alt="trend line loess" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/trendline-loess.png">

##### Export chart

Scatter explorer also, gives ability to `export` your chart as `image`.

By clicking `export button` from control panel, will be opened chart preview modal.
You can change exportable chart `image width`, `single chart height`, set `image name` and `format`.

<img alt="export chart" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #E8F1FC" src="https://docs-blobs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/ui/pages/scatters-explorer/export-chart.png">
