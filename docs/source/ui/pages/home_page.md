There are four main sections:

* [Statistics and Activity](#statistics-and-activity)

* [Integrate Aim with your code](#integrate-aim-with-your-code)

* [Explore Aim](#explore-aim)

* [Get Involved](#get-involved)

#### Statistics and activity

Use the Statistics and activity to obvserve general info about your experiments and runs.

The `heatmap` shows the intensity of experiments you have made for the day - the darker the color the more experiments.

Each cell represents the set of training runs for that day.

The cells are clickable!

Once clicked, you will navigate to the [Runs explorer](../pages/run_management.html#runs-explorer) page and automatically [query](../../using/search.html) the runs made on that day.
